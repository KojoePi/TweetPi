# Orange Pi Tweetbot
I've written some files in python for use with twython.
To make it work you have to follow these steps:

sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo easy_install pip

sudo pip install twython

Then register an app on twitter. 
Replace the Placeholders with your api keys and secrets.
Start tweeting statusupdates from your orange pi!
